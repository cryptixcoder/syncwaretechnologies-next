    SOS Stop Substance Abuse was developed in partnership with BeProud Foundation and bEsTcOrE Arts & Technology Innovations Inc. to provide a tool to students, teachers, and counselors to teach the dangers of illegal substances. Additionally, we developed an emergency alert system, where app users can add emergency contacts and when they are having a medical emergency the contacts will receive the location that can be pulled up in any map app to get directions to them or call them straight from the alert.
