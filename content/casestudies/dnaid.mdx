  Like many people who want to know their ancestry, they buy a DNA kit from the various companies out there. But once you get that information you typically forget about the account and never really use it until you get an email notifying you of an update. The one thing most people overlook is that many of those services offers you a file that represents your DNA in their respective genetic pairs. When it comes to research, this data is invaluable in the fight to diagnose and treat illnesses. The problem is that researchers have a hard time finding individuals to connect with, let alone the expensive process of having to run the DNA labs from scratch for each person they sign on. Craig Calderone had the same idea and wanted to solve that issue using next-gen technology with DNAID and partnered with Syncware Technologies to build the MVP.
