 Two artists from the city of Chester, Aaliyah Al-Amin and Devon Walls set out to build a place within their hometown that served healthy and delicious foods to the community and that's when Brother's Restaurant was born. Since they were a new business and wanted an simple solution for customers to learn about the menu they offered, we partnered with the pair to design and develop a clean and modern landing page two introduce the retaurant and serve as their digital menu.
